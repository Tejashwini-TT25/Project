# Project
This project presents a test application for manipulating the RXSR register's fields in modern embedded systems. Utilizing the reg_setup.h header file and libregsim64.a library, the application features a menu-driven interface for reading and writing individual fields, ensuring precise control over hardware registers. Key components include structure definition, field initialization, read/write functions, and a display function for easier debugging. This project contributes to the reliability and efficiency of embedded systems by verifying the proper functionality of the RXSR register fields.
